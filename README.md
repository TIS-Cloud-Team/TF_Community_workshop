# Introduction 
* This repo contains the community IP for 'Getting Started with Terraform on Azure'. 
* It is targetted at audience who are new to Terraform and Infrastrcuture-as-Code (though, prior ARM experience would be beneficial as well)
* We'll be focusing more on core constructs of Terraform that are required to write well-structured and maintainable code.
* PPTs directory contains the decks and Labs directory contains instructions. Participants are expected to bring their own Azure Dev Environment. (or MSDN subscription)
    * Unless subscription passes can be arranged 

# Getting Started
* Have a look at Delivery Guide 
* 00_Workshop_Introduction.pptx (in PPTs) contain information on environment setup
* See Labs directory for step-by-step lab instructions. (will need to be kept updated as new AzureRM plugin versions are released)

# Build and Test
* **[Recommended]** Try out all the labs and keep a separate version of completed solution ready prior to delivery. 
* The above will be needed to show hands-on demos which usually makes up for at least 50% of the delivery.
* A pre-completed set of demos are located in Demos directory but **please make sure to test them out thoroughly yourself** prior to delivery.

# Delivery Format

## Typical delivery options

### 1. Base Delivery
This delivery should teach our customer about core Terraform Constructs for writing maintainable Infrastrcuture as Code. Foundations content should include:

* All the Items in PPTs
* Standard Demos (Demos Directory)
* More emphasis on learning Core Terraform components like Configuration Options, Functions, Modules, State Management, etc. 
* Prescriptive Labs (ones in Labs directory)

Duration: 1 Day

### 2. Base Delivery + Extended Custom Demos and Labs Session

This delivery will include:

* All the content in base delivery plus extended demos around provisioning VMs, Kubernetes Clusters, Deploying from Github Actions, etc. 
* Spending additional time going in-depth on core topics.
* Adding an extended Q&A / Chalk and Talk component focused specifically on customer's problem domain. (2nd day afternoon. This part varies for each delivery according to scope)

CEs delivering this should already be well familiar with Terraform as this is meant for slightly more advanced audience and demos are setup on-demand basis. (Not included here)

If in doubt and looking for a L200 Terraform IP, just go with the 1 day Base Delivery.

Duration: 2 Days
